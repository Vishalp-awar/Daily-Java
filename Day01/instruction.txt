Steps to Run Code:

1. Create a file with the .java extension.

2. Copy and paste the code from Test.java into your file. (Note: The class name should match the file name. For example, if the file name is Test.java, the class inside should be class Test {}.)

3. Save the file.

4. Open a terminal in the current directory. (Right-click on an empty space in the directory and select Open Terminal, or use Git Bash, Command Prompt, etc.)

5. Type the following command with the complete file name and .java extension:
   
    Example: javac Test.java

    This will create a .class file in the same directory.

6. Type a new command to run the program and see the output:

    Example: java Test
    
    This will print: "Hello World!!!"
